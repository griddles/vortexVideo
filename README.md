# Vortex Video v0.1.0

---

Vortex aims to be a video hosting platform in competition with Youtube, but with much better policies and services.   
Some of these include:   
 - A non intrusive algorithm   
 - Much more power given to creators over things like ads   
 - A much looser content guideline system that still blocks actually harmful content, not "guns with magazines of over 10 rounds" like Youtube   
 - A system in which all users are notified of changes at least a week before they release, and creators are given a vote on whether the change should be kept, modified, or discarded, both before and after the change is released. Obviously this wouldn't apply to some changes, like stuff having to do with the backend stuff or other very important changes.    

It's probably a bad idea to follow this repo unless you actually wanna help out developing it, since I commit stuff way too often and without making major changes sometimes, so you'll just get a bunch of garbage notifications.

### How to get involved

Join the Vortex Development Discord at https://discord.gg/5zWxzwAukj and send a message in the #applications channel with your qualifications, why you want to help out, etc. If I think you're a good fit, I'll add you to the team.   
Currently I have no funding for this, but if I can get enough support hopefully I'll be able to turn this into a real company and start hiring actual developers, maybe even some of you guys if you're up for that.   

We currently need (in order of importance):

 - HTML/CSS/PHP/JS devs, to make the core of the website
 - someone who can write some backend code, like stuff to handle the video uploading process and also the algorithm, preferably in something like c# but if you know a language  that is 1: somewhat commonly used 2: relatively easy to learn and use and 3: more efficient than c# then that would work too
 - someone who knows how to write SQL and use mySQL databases
 - someone who can handle server hosting stuff so we can actually make this a website
 - graphic designers

you dont necessarily have to fit exactly to these, if you know more about web design/database stuff/server hosting than me (you probably do) and there's a different/better way to do all this then just hop in the discord and tell me.

### Who am I?

I'm currently taking college classes in various different programming languages, including HTML/CSS. I'm sick of Youtube getting away with everything because they're the only good video platform, so I wanna change that.   

Obviously I'm pretty underqualified for something of this scale at the moment, but I'm trying to learn as fast as I can. Most of my code is gonna be super inefficient and garbage since I literally started HTML/CSS/PHP/JS last week, so if you see anything problematic just let me know and give me a way to fix it and I'll make it better.   

Also, as a bunch of different people I've met have said, "An employer is hiring you to do something better than they can." It's a little different since I wouldn't be exactly hiring you, but you get the point. You'll probably be way better than me at whatever you join the team to do, which is why I want you to join the team.   

If you want an idea of what my work looks like, just check out some of the other stuff I've uploaded to github.
